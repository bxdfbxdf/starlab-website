We have a detailed process for collecting high resolution data on-site with LiDAR and UAV scans. Whether it's a complex manufacturing plant, a sprawling urban infrastructure, or a state-of-the-art medical device, our Digital Twins stand as paragons of precision, offering a holistic view of their physical counterparts in real-time.

Once we have gathered environmental data, we process and clean the 3d geometry to produce effecient and clean models that can be deployed to all platforms.
