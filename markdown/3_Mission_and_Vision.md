# RELLIS Starlab Facility: Advancing Texas and global industries through engineering innovation

The 2,000-acre RELLIS campus promotes advanced research and technology development and education. Through the RELLIS Starlab Facility, academic, government and industry partners, along with Texas A&M students, faculty and staff, collaborate to find innovative solutions to pressing engineering and technology challenges that affect the community, the state of Texas, the nation and ultimately, the world.

* Large scale testing facility 
* Enable testing of various scenarios including (AR/VR)
* Constructing scaled cities for real world simulations
* Collaborative simulations with Aerial/Ground Vehicles
* Human Machine Interaction
* Certification and V&V for Autonomous Vehicles

## Mission & Vision

The RELLIS Starlab Facility exists to benefit society through the motivation and generation of scholarship in the technical disciplines that involve smart system design and control. We develop disruptive, deployable technologies based on the innovative application of smart design strategies, tools, and techniques. We also conduct focused research on the development of novel algorithms, analysis and implementations of autonomous vehicle systems with an explicit focus on safety technologies, methods, processes and technology transfer. We aim to inspire the children of today to become the scientific and engineering innovators of tomorrow through ongoing outreach efforts in the surrounding community.
